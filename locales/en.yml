  testimonial:
    text: |
      By following my consumption on a daily basis, as well as my feelings and
      the intensity of my cravings, my addiction psychiatrist was able to see
      patterns in my behavior. She helped me to concentrate on those doses that
      I was able to reduce or replace.<br/>
      <br/>
      Without Dependn', I would never have had the courage to have come so far.
      It just wouldn't have been possible. That's why I want to share Dependn’
      with you today
